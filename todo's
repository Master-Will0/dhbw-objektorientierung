1: create Background with Arena
  Arena: left part of a parabola, horizontal line, right part of a parabola  ==> fill area under the curve
2: create Car Class:
  private int   velocityX Y + positionX Y, rotation,     bool mirrored (for driving direction)
  public function   set, get, accelerate(changes velocity), move(changes position), rotate, mirror
3: implement car motion
  move function in draw()
  accelerate function in update() and call if left/right is pressed
  freefall motion
4: implement object interaction:                  
  driving up the ramps(rotate car by tan(slope) and move by parabola.    anchor point is either the car-center or the tires )
  cars hit eachother(approximating shape), (bounce back with half ot the median velocity??)
(5: hitpoints and maybe powerups or flying)


Comments:
  4. is might be a bit difficult. rest is easy
