1: create Background with Arena
  Arena: left part of a parabola, horizontal line, right part of a parabola  ==> fill area under the curve
2: create Car Object:
  private int   velocityX Y + positionX Y, 
  public function   set, get, accelerate(changes velocity), move(changes position) 
3: implement car motion
  move function in draw()
  accelerate function in update() and call if left/right is pressed
  freefall motion
4: implement object interaction:                  
  cars hit eachother, driving up the ramps
5: hitpoints and maybe powerups or flying
